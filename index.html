    <p>Hello, I&#39;m a 2nd year Telematics Engineering PhD Student @ <a href="https://networks.imdea.org/">IMDEA Networks Intitute</a> and <a href="https://www.uc3m.es/telematic-engineering-department/home">UC3M</a> in Madrid, Spain. </p>
    <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><p>I&#39;m a part of the <a href="https://networks.imdea.org/team/research-groups/networks-data-science-group/">Networks Data Science Group</a>, under the supervision of Dr. Marco Fiore. There, I work with statistical analysis and data mining of the metadata that flows under mobile networks. I&#39;m mostly interested in remove sensing and statistical modeling of network behaviors through the lenses of operational networks. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>I&#39;m currently based in Cambridge as a visiting student at the Computer Lab of the University of Cambridge. 
    I&#39;ve previously been located at the SENSE Lab for Orange Innovations in Paris, France. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Before starting my PhD, I received both my Master and Bachelor degrees in Telecommunications Engineering from UFPR in Curitiba, Brazil. </p>
