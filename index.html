      Hello, I'm a researcher whose main focus has been in large-scale (mobile) networks measurements, 
      the processing and creation of these datasets and developing tools and methodologies capable of extracting insights from the data, 
      not only for networks, but for any general sciences who are interested in the data.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll soon be relocating to Barcelona, where I'll start a new research position in industry :)

        <p>
          I received my PhD degree in Telematics Engineering from <a href="https://www.uc3m.es/telematic-engineering-department/home">UC3M</a> in 2024, 
          and during that time I was a Research assistant at <a href="https://networks.imdea.org/">IMDEA Networks Intitute</a> and 
          a part of the <a href="https://networks.imdea.org/team/research-groups/networks-data-science-group/">Networks Data Science Group</a>, under the supervision of Dr. Marco Fiore.
          My <a href="https://dspace.networks.imdea.org/handle/20.500.12761/1852">thesis</a> was titled 
          "Characterizing Large-Scale  Mobile Traffic Measurements for  Urban, Social and Networks Sciences", 
          where I showcased the vast array of research possible with mobile traffic measurements, specifically app-level traffic flows, not only for networks but also for general sciences.

          I got my Masters and Bachelors in Telecommunications Engineering from UFPR (Brazil) in 2020 and 2018, respectively. 
          While there, I was a part of the <a href="https://gics.ufpr.br/">Group of Integrated Circuits and Systems (GICS)</a>, 
          where I researched modeling methods for radiofrequency microelectronics (DPDs, to be more specific).

          On my free time I mainly like to climb (currently transition away from plastic to more real rocks), 
          as well as complain about movies and <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/boomer_k">music</a>.

      My <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=meMA_KcAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a> is the best place to find the most up-to-date list of works, 
      but here is a small list of my works (all hopefully publicly available):
